  "about_content": "This app was developed by Miker Works under the name Finiware. I developed this app because my son has asthma and needs various medications through a spacer (puffs) every day. Of course you keep track of it on paper, but there is an app for that as of now. This app keeps track of how much has been used per medicine and can therefore indicate when a new medicine is needed. Often the maximum number of puffs is 200. This is the default amount in the app. However, you can adjust this yourself. This also applies to the number for warning level: the moment at which the counter changes color so that you can order additional medications from the pharmacy or doctor in a timely manner. Be sure to read the disclaimer: You are responsible for correct administration of the necessary medications. If in doubt, always consult your doctor. You can add additional medications to the counter list yourself. You will find some of them in the list if you click on the button, such as salbutamol, qvar and foster. You can add other medications yourself. You can adjust the data for each medicine counter, such as the name, description and color. You can also reset or correct the counter via the settings screen. To do this, press the pencil button in the overview screen. All counters can be found in the overview screen. There you can quickly see the current counter reading, but also increase the counter by 1 or 4 puffs. The menu options, including the logbook, are visible via the menu button at the top left. This contains the date and time, the medicine and the amount of medicine. I hope this app is useful for you too. Rotterdam, October 2023, Mike van Drongelen",
